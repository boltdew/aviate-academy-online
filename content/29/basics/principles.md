# Hydraulic System Principles

## Introduction

Hydraulic systems are essential components in modern aircraft, providing the power needed to operate critical flight controls, landing gear, and other systems. Understanding the basic principles of hydraulics is fundamental for aircraft maintenance technicians.

## Pascal's Law

The foundation of hydraulic systems is Pascal's Law, which states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted equally in all directions. This principle allows us to multiply force using hydraulic systems.

### Key Concepts:
- **Pressure**: Force per unit area (P = F/A)
- **Fluid incompressibility**: Liquids cannot be compressed significantly
- **Force multiplication**: Small input force creates large output force

## Basic Components

### Reservoir
- Stores hydraulic fluid
- Provides fluid expansion space
- Contains filters and sight gauges

### Pump
- Creates system pressure
- Types: Engine-driven, electric, hand pumps
- Maintains constant pressure for system operation

### Actuators
- Convert hydraulic pressure to mechanical force
- Linear actuators (cylinders)
- Rotary actuators (motors)

## System Pressure

Most aircraft hydraulic systems operate at:
- **High pressure**: 3000 PSI (21 MPa)
- **Backup systems**: 1500-2000 PSI
- **Emergency systems**: Variable pressure

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **Warning**: Hydraulic systems operate at extremely high pressures. Always:
- Depressurize systems before maintenance
- Use proper PPE
- Follow lockout/tagout procedures
- Never attempt to stop leaks with hands

## Next Steps

After mastering these principles, you'll be ready to study:
- Hydraulic fluids and their properties
- System components in detail
- Troubleshooting procedures
- Maintenance practices

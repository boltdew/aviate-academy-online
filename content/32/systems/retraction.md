# Landing Gear Retraction Systems

## System Overview

Landing gear retraction systems allow aircraft to retract and extend the landing gear for improved aerodynamic efficiency during flight and safe ground operations.

## Retraction Methods

### Hydraulic Retraction
- Most common system type
- High power-to-weight ratio
- Reliable operation
- Fast cycle times

### Electric Retraction
- Used on smaller aircraft
- Slower operation
- Lower maintenance
- Backup power available

### Manual Emergency Extension
- Backup system requirement
- Gravity or spring-assisted
- Independent of main power
- Pilot-operated mechanisms

## System Components

### Retraction Actuators
- Linear hydraulic cylinders
- Rotary actuators
- Side-brace actuators
- Door actuators

### Selector Valves
- Pilot-operated controls
- Position indication
- Safety interlocks
- Emergency override

### Sequence Valves
- Proper retraction sequence
- Door operation timing
- Gear position coordination
- System protection

## Gear Doors

### Door Types
- Single-piece doors
- Multi-panel doors
- Bifold doors
- Sliding doors

### Door Operation
- Synchronized with gear
- Hydraulic or spring operation
- Position indication
- Emergency procedures

## Position Indication

### Gear Position Lights
- Green: Gear down and locked
- Red: Gear in transit or unsafe
- No light: Gear up and locked

### Warning Systems
- Gear up with flaps/power
- Unsafe gear conditions
- System malfunctions
- Audio and visual alerts

## Safety Systems

### Gear Locks
- Mechanical up-locks
- Down-locks and safety pins
- Lock indication switches
- Manual lock releases

### Pressure Switches
- System pressure monitoring
- Low pressure warnings
- Pump operation control
- Backup system activation

### Squat Switches
- Weight-on-wheels indication
- System logic control
- Prevents inadvertent retraction
- Ground safety interlocks

## Maintenance Procedures

### Operational Checks
- Retraction/extension cycles
- Door operation verification
- Position indication testing
- Warning system checks

### Pressure Testing
- System pressure verification
- Leak testing procedures
- Accumulator precharge
- Relief valve settings

### Rigging Adjustments
- Door timing adjustments
- Gear alignment checks
- Lock mechanism adjustment
- Indicator switch calibration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems
- Slow or incomplete retraction
- Door operation issues
- Position indication failures
- Hydraulic leaks

### Diagnostic Steps
1. System pressure check
2. Visual inspection
3. Operational testing
4. Component isolation
5. Repair or replacement

## Emergency Procedures

### Manual Extension
- Emergency extension handle
- Gravity drop systems
- Hand pump operation
- Positive indication requirements

### Partial Extension
- Troubleshooting procedures
- Safety considerations
- Landing techniques
- Damage assessment

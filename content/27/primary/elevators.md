# Elevator Control Systems

## Overview

Elevator control systems provide longitudinal (pitch) control of the aircraft, allowing pilots to control the aircraft's nose-up or nose-down attitude.

## System Architecture

### Control Surfaces
- Primary elevators
- Elevator tabs
- Balance tabs
- Trim tabs

### Control Linkages
- Push-pull rods
- Cables and pulleys
- Bellcranks and levers
- Hydraulic actuators

## Types of Elevator Systems

### Manual Control
- Direct mechanical linkage
- Pilot force feedback
- Simple and reliable
- Used in smaller aircraft

### Power-Assisted Control
- Hydraulic boost systems
- Reduced pilot workload
- Maintains control feel
- Backup manual reversion

### Fly-by-Wire Control
- Electronic signal transmission
- Computer-controlled surfaces
- Artificial feel systems
- Advanced protection logic

## Control Surface Rigging

### Critical Measurements
- Control surface travel limits
- Cable tensions
- Rod end adjustments
- Tab settings

### Rigging Procedures
1. Aircraft positioning
2. Control lock installation
3. Surface position verification
4. Cable tension adjustment
5. Final operational checks

## Trim Systems

### Functions
- Reduce pilot workload
- Maintain desired flight attitude
- Compensate for changing conditions

### Types
- Manual trim wheels
- Electric trim motors
- Hydraulic trim actuators
- Automatic trim systems

## Maintenance Requirements

### Routine Inspections
- Control surface condition
- Hinge point lubrication
- Cable condition and tension
- Actuator operation

### Functional Tests
- Control surface travel
- Trim operation
- System response time
- Emergency procedures

## Safety Systems

### Gust Alleviation
- Load limiting devices
- Breakaway mechanisms
- Structural protection

### Redundancy
- Dual hydraulic systems
- Manual reversion capability
- Independent trim systems
- Backup power sources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Binding or restricted movement
- Control surface flutter
- Trim runaway
- Actuator malfunctions

### Diagnostic Approach
1. Symptom identification
2. System isolation
3. Component testing
4. Corrective action
5. Functional verification

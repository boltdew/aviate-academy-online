# Aircraft Alternators and Generators

## Types of Generators

### DC Generators
- Wound field generators
- Permanent magnet generators
- Compound wound configurations

### AC Alternators
- Three-phase alternators
- Single-phase alternators
- Variable frequency systems
- Constant frequency systems

## Constant Speed Drive (CSD)

### Function
- Maintains constant alternator speed
- Compensates for engine RPM variations
- Ensures stable frequency output

### Components
- Hydraulic transmission
- Governor control system
- Disconnect mechanism
- Oil cooling system

## Integrated Drive Generator (IDG)

### Advantages
- Combined CSD and generator
- Reduced weight and complexity
- Improved reliability
- Simplified installation

### Operation
- Direct engine drive
- Internal speed regulation
- Self-contained oil system
- Built-in protection systems

## Generator Control Units (GCU)

### Functions
- Voltage regulation
- Frequency control
- Load sharing
- Protection coordination

### Protection Features
- Over-voltage protection
- Under-voltage protection
- Over-current protection
- Reverse power protection
- Differential protection

## Parallel Operation

### Load Sharing
- Real power sharing
- Reactive power control
- Frequency synchronization
- Voltage matching

### Synchronization Process
1. Voltage matching
2. Frequency matching
3. Phase matching
4. Paralleling sequence

## Maintenance Procedures

### Routine Inspections
- Visual inspection of connections
- Vibration checks
- Temperature monitoring
- Oil level and condition

### Electrical Tests
- Insulation resistance testing
- Continuity checks
- Load testing
- Protection system testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Voltage regulation problems

# Electrical Power Generation

## Overview

Aircraft electrical systems generate, distribute, and control electrical power for all aircraft systems and equipment.

## Generation Sources

### Engine-Driven Generators
- AC generators (alternators)
- DC generators
- Integrated drive generators (IDG)

### Auxiliary Power Unit (APU)
- Ground power generation
- Emergency backup power
- Pre-flight system operation

### Battery Systems
- Emergency power source
- Engine start capability
- Essential system backup

## Power Distribution

### AC Power System
- 115V 400Hz three-phase power
- Essential and non-essential buses
- Automatic load shedding

### DC Power System
- 28V DC power
- Battery charging circuits
- Emergency power distribution

## System Protection

- Circuit breakers
- Current limiters
- Overvoltage protection
- Undervoltage detection

## Maintenance Requirements

Regular maintenance includes:
- Generator inspection
- Battery condition checks
- Circuit breaker testing
- Voltage regulation verification

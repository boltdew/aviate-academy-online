# DC Electrical Systems

## Introduction

Direct Current (DC) electrical systems form the backbone of many aircraft electrical installations, providing reliable power for critical systems and equipment.

## DC System Characteristics

### Voltage Levels
- **28V DC**: Most common aircraft voltage
- **14V DC**: Used in smaller aircraft
- **270V DC**: High-voltage DC systems

### System Configuration
- Single-wire systems (ground return)
- Two-wire systems (isolated return)
- Split-bus configurations

## Power Sources

### Engine-Driven Generators
- Constant speed drive units
- Brushless alternators with rectification
- Integrated drive generators (IDG)

### Batteries
- Nickel-Cadmium (NiCad)
- Lead-Acid
- Lithium-Ion (newer aircraft)

### Ground Power Units
- External DC power supply
- Battery charging capabilities
- System testing support

## Distribution System

### Bus Bars
- Main DC bus
- Essential DC bus
- Emergency DC bus
- Battery bus

### Protection Devices
- Circuit breakers
- Fuses
- Current limiters
- Reverse current relays

## Load Management

### Essential Loads
- Flight instruments
- Navigation equipment
- Communication systems
- Engine controls

### Non-Essential Loads
- Cabin lighting
- Entertainment systems
- Galley equipment
- Passenger services

## System Monitoring

Monitoring includes:
- Voltage levels
- Current flow
- Generator output
- Battery condition

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **Warning**: DC systems can be dangerous:
- Always use proper lockout/tagout
- Check for stored energy in capacitors
- Use appropriate PPE
- Follow electrical safety procedures

# Fuel System Overview

## Introduction

The aircraft fuel system is responsible for storing, managing, and delivering fuel to the engines. This system ensures proper fuel flow, quantity indication, and system monitoring.

## Key Components

### Fuel Tanks
- Main tanks (left and right wings)
- Center tank (if equipped)
- Auxiliary tanks (if equipped)

### Fuel Pumps
- Engine-driven mechanical pumps
- Electric boost pumps
- Transfer pumps

### Fuel Lines and Valves
- Supply lines
- Return lines
- Shut-off valves
- Cross-feed valves

## System Operation

The fuel system operates under both normal and emergency conditions, providing reliable fuel delivery to maintain safe flight operations.

### Normal Operation
1. Fuel flows from tanks through filters
2. Boost pumps provide positive pressure
3. Engine-driven pumps draw fuel for combustion
4. Fuel quantity is continuously monitored

### Emergency Procedures
- Manual fuel management
- Cross-feed operations
- Fuel jettison (if equipped)

## Maintenance Considerations

Regular inspection and maintenance of the fuel system includes:
- Fuel filter replacement
- Pump inspection
- Line integrity checks
- Quantity system calibration

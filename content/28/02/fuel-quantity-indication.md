# Fuel Quantity Indication System

## System Purpose

The fuel quantity indication system provides accurate fuel quantity information to flight crew, enabling proper fuel management and flight planning.

## Components

### Fuel Quantity Transmitters
- Capacitance-type sensors
- Multiple units per tank
- Temperature compensation

### Indication System
- Cockpit fuel quantity gauges
- Digital displays
- Low fuel warning lights

## Operation Principles

### Capacitance Measurement
The system uses the principle that fuel and air have different dielectric constants, allowing precise measurement of fuel levels.

### Signal Processing
1. Transmitter signals are processed by fuel quantity units
2. Signals are converted to usable cockpit indications
3. System provides continuous real-time data

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include:
- Erratic quantity indications
- Stuck or inaccurate readings
- Warning light malfunctions

## Maintenance Procedures

- Regular calibration checks
- Transmitter inspection
- Wiring integrity verification
- System accuracy testing

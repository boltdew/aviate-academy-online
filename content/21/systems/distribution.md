# Air Distribution Systems

## Distribution Network

The air distribution system ensures that conditioned air reaches all areas of the aircraft cabin efficiently and evenly.

## Main Distribution Components

### Distribution Manifolds
- Primary distribution manifold
- Secondary distribution lines
- Individual cabin outlets

### Flow Control Valves
- Temperature control valves
- Volume control dampers
- Emergency shutoff valves

## Cabin Zones

### Passenger Cabin
- Overhead distribution
- Under-seat return air
- Individual passenger controls

### Flight Deck
- Dedicated temperature control
- Independent air supply
- Enhanced filtration

### Cargo Compartments
- Temperature monitoring
- Humidity control for sensitive cargo
- Emergency ventilation systems

## Air Flow Patterns

Understanding proper air flow ensures:
- Even temperature distribution
- Adequate air exchange rates
- Minimal contamination spread

## Maintenance Points

Regular inspection of:
- Distribution ducting
- Outlet grilles and filters
- Control valve operation
- Temperature sensors

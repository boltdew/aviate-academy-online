# Air Conditioning System Introduction

## Overview

Aircraft air conditioning systems are essential for maintaining a comfortable and safe environment for passengers and crew during flight. These systems control temperature, humidity, and air quality within the aircraft cabin.

## Key Functions

### Temperature Control
- Maintain comfortable cabin temperature
- Adapt to varying external conditions
- Provide heating and cooling as needed

### Air Quality Management
- Filter incoming air
- Control humidity levels
- Ensure adequate ventilation

## System Components

### Air Cycle Machine (ACM)
The heart of the air conditioning system that:
- Compresses incoming air
- Cools the air through expansion
- Removes moisture from the air

### Heat Exchangers
- Primary heat exchanger
- Secondary heat exchanger
- Intercooler

## Operating Principles

The air conditioning system operates on the air cycle refrigeration principle, using compressed air from the engine compressor stages. This air is cooled, dried, and distributed throughout the cabin.

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: Always follow proper procedures when:
- Servicing air conditioning components
- Checking system pressures
- Performing maintenance tasks

## Next Steps
